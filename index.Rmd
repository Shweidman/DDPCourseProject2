## Motivation for the weight loss app

Suppose you want to lose a lot of weight--say, 20 pounds by Christmas. 

Why might you have trouble?

**Because it's hard!**

What would make it easier?

Having a series of intermediate goals to motivate you.

This app gives you a series of easier-to-hit, intermediate goals to help you **achieve your dreams!**.

## Steps to use the app

1. Input what day you would like to achieve your goal by.
2. Say how much you currently weigh
3. Say how much weight you would like to lose
4. Say which days of the week you would like to check in on

**The output will be a series of goals to hit along the way to your ultimate weight loss goal!**

## Example

You want to lose 30 lbs by Halloween, and you currently weight 230. Here's what your output would look like:

## The underlying code: ui.r

```{r}
shinyUI(pageWithSidebar(
  headerPanel("Weight loss app"),
  sidebarPanel(
    numericInput('currentWeight',"What is your current weight?",0,min=0,max=500,step=1),
    numericInput('weightLoss',"How many pounds would you like to lose?",0,min=0,max=500,step=1),
    dateInput("goalDate","By when would you like to lose this weight?"),
    radioButtons("weekday",label="Day of week to check in",
                 choices = list("Monday" = "Monday","Tuesday" = "Tuesday","Wednesday" = "Wednesday",
                                "Thursday" = "Thursday","Friday" = "Friday","Saturday" = "Saturday",
                                "Sunday" = "Sunday"),
                 selected = "Monday")
    ), 
  mainPanel(
    h3("Your schedule for losing weight is:"),
    dataTableOutput("goalTableFinal")
    )
))
```

## The underlying code: server.r 

```{r}

goalTable <- function(currentWeight,weightLoss,goalDate,weekday) {
  goalWeight <- currentWeight - weightLoss
  currentDate <- Sys.Date()
  goalDate <- as.Date(goalDate)
  daysUntilGoal <- as.numeric(difftime(goalDate,currentDate,units="days"))
  poundsPerDay <- weightLoss/daysUntilGoal
  goalTable <- data.frame(date = as.Date(rep(Sys.Date(),daysUntilGoal)),
                          weight = rep(currentWeight,daysUntilGoal),
                          weekdays = weekdays(as.Date(rep(Sys.Date(),daysUntilGoal))),

    goalTable[i,1] <- as.Date(currentDate + i)
    goalTable[i,2] <- round(currentWeight - i*poundsPerDay,1)
    goalTable[i,3] <- weekdays(goalTable[i,1])
